Meaningful Design (URL of new and old design):

Old Design: https://thaotea.github.io/lab2/ingredients.html

New Design: https://thaotea.github.io/lab2/ingredTest.html

Description of Comparative Evaluation:

For our redesign, we decided to focus on the ingredients page. The original page is titled “My Ingredients” and has a feature to add an ingredient (“Add New”), with that ingredient popping up under to form a list of all ingredients. The redesign is titled “Add Ingredients” with 3 text boxes to fill out (“Ingredient”, “Expiration Date (mm/dd/yyyy)”, “Description”) and an “Add” button at the bottom to click once the user is finished filling in the boxes. The ingredients and their corresponding information show up below under “My Ingredients”. 

For the comparative evaluation we will have users test both versions, assigning the order of testing at random and not telling them which is the original. We will observe the user and take notes on how the user interacts with the pages. We will be measuring qualitative data by taking note of the user’s actions, errors and comments as s/he goes through both pages. We will also ask the user on his or her overall thoughts on each page. 

We think that users will tend to prefer the redesign page over the original. We think that users will think that our redesign is more intuitive and organized than our original. Users may have trouble discovering the delete option on our original design. Additionally, users may appreciate the option to add an expiration date and a description to an ingredient in our redesign. We also think users will prefer a separate section to add ingredients and to view all inputted ingredients. They may think the original version is too simple or has the potential to appear cluttered easily. 

With our final design in mind, we think generally users will like the redesign. However, they may think that a more organized list of all ingredients would be helpful; for example, sorting each ingredient by category (e.g.: produce, dairy, protein, etc). They may also want a more intuitive way to delete or edit ingredients.
